    <h2>All About Robin Kelley</h2>
    <p>
        Hello! This semester in Web Programming I am interested in fleshing out my knowledge set in html, css and javascript. As I move forward to hopefully teach Computer Science in a high school space it is very important for me to understand and be able to implement these concepts well enough to teach them to students.
